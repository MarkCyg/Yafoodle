# Yafoodle

This project is an interactive Front End Project that utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, Edamam API, Youtube API, variables, local storage, fetch and function requests. 
We were tasked with conceving and executing a design that solved a real world problem by integrating data recived gtom multiple server-side API requests. 

The search bar gives you different options for cuisines, and gives you different different dietery restrictions to choose from. When the search button is clicked you are given five different recipes and five different youtube videos related to the serach.

GIVEN I search for a recipe,
WHEN I click the search button,
THEN I am presented with a list of 5 random recipes that fit my search criteria.
